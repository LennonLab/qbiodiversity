### Learning objectives
**Quantitative Biodiversity is organized around the following learning objectives**
***Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:***
1. Identify and discuss core concepts of biodiversity
2. Quantify and compare measures of taxonomic diversity within and among samples
3. Quantify the distribution of traits and species in a phylogenetic context
4. Evaluate biodiversity in spatial and temporal contexts
5. Use the R programming language to analyze and visualize biodiversity data
6. Use GitHub for conducting and managing reproducible research projects

### Student assessment
* **Assignments:** Students will be given worksheets containing in-class exercises, which will also include assignments that need to be submitted via GitHub.
* **Reading:** When assigned, students will need to read literature prior to class meetings. 
* **Group project:** Students will be assigned to groups and will conduct an independent project that will be presented to the class.
* **Participation:** Students will need to attend and actively engage in discussion and computational exercises.

### Late assignments
We realize that the pandemic can create challenges for meeting professional obligations. Therefore, we encourage you to let us know if you are having problems. Otherwise, if assignments are submitted less than 24 hours after the deadline, grade on that assignment will automatically be reduced 50 % prior to grading. Assignments submitted > 24 hours after deadline will receive no credit. You will receive an incomplete for the course if you receive two or more no-credit evaluations or if you receive four or more half-credit evaluations.  

### Academic integrity
As a student at IU, you are expected to adhere to the standards and policies detailed in the [Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct](http://www.iu.edu/~code/). When you submit an assignment with your name on it in this course, you are signifying that the work contained therein is all yours, unless otherwise cited or referenced. Similar standards are assumed for presentations and the generation of web-based media. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. If you are unsure about the expectations for completing an assignment, be sure to seek clarification beforehand. All suspected violations of the Code will be handled according to University policies. Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment, reduction in your final grade, a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities, and must include a report to the Dean of Students.

### Attendance
Given the small number of class meetings and group work involved in the class, synchronous attendance is required. Unexcused absences will negatively affect a student's grade. Any conflicts should be communicated to the instructor as early as possible, preferably before the beginning of the semester.
