### Computational approaches to biodiversity using R And GitHub
In this course, we will be using [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) as complimentary tools for learning quantitative biodiversity. R is a free, open-source programming language that is widely used for data visualization and statistics. Specifically, [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) that will allow us to interface with other packages, including [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/). Last, we will be using GitHub as a version control system to track, record, and recover changes throughout the history of a project. 
GitHub is the premier tool for collaborative and social development of computing-based projects, allowing instructors, students, and collaborators to develop a project (or class) from remote locations. We will use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to host course material including this syllabus, code, and exercises. Each student will have their own GitHub repository and will use GitHub to store and submit their work.

### Other course resources
PDF versions of required papers, along with slides from class lectures can be posted on the IU's learning management system, [Canvas](http://goo.gl/tTmEe7). 
We will be using [Slack](https://slack.com/) as a primary way to communicate and problem-solve over the duration of the course. 

### Student assessment
* **Assignments:** Students will be given worksheets containing in-class exercises, which will also include assignments that need to be submitted via GitHub.
* **Reading:** When assigned, students will need to read literature prior to class meetings. 
* **Group project:** Students will be assigned to groups and will conduct an independent project that will be presented to the class.
* **Participation:** Students will need to attend and actively engage in discussion and computational exercises.

### Late assignments
We realize that the pandemic can create challenges for meeting professional obligations. Therefore, we encourage you to let us know if you are having problems. Otherwise, if assignments are submitted less than 24 hours after the deadline, grade on that assignment will automatically be reduced 50 % prior to grading. Assignments submitted > 24 hours after deadline will receive no credit. You will receive an incomplete for the course if you receive two or more no-credit evaluations or if you receive four or more half-credit evaluations.  

### Academic integrity
As a student at IU, you are expected to adhere to the standards and policies detailed in the [Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct](http://www.iu.edu/~code/). When you submit an assignment with your name on it in this course, you are signifying that the work contained therein is all yours, unless otherwise cited or referenced. Similar standards are assumed for presentations and the generation of web-based media. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. If you are unsure about the expectations for completing an assignment, be sure to seek clarification beforehand. All suspected violations of the Code will be handled according to University policies. Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment, reduction in your final grade, a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities, and must include a report to the Dean of Students.

### Attendance
Given the small number of class meetings and group work involved in the class, synchronous attendance is required. Unexcused absences will negatively affect a student's grade. Any conflicts should be communicated to the instructor as early as possible, preferably before the beginning of the semester.

### Special needs
Please contact the course director as soon as possible if you have a documented disability or any other issues that will interfere your performance of the activities planned for the class.
